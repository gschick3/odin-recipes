        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup butter (melted)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pumpkin puree</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line an 8x8 inch baking dish with aluminum foil. Lightly grease the foil. In a bowl combine flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl mix together melted butter, sugar, and vanilla. Beat in the eggs (one at a time)</li>
        <li>Add in the flour mixture a little at a time and stir until the batter is evenly moistened. Divide the batter in half evenly into 2 separate bowls.</li>
        <li>In one of the bowls, blend in the cocoa powder and chocolate chips. In the second bowl of batter, stir in pumpkin puree, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/2 of the chocolate batter mixture into the bottom of the baking dish. Pour 1/2 of the pumpkin batter mixture over that. Repeat the layers, ending with a pumpkin layer. Drag a kitchen knife or spatula through the layers in a swirling motion to create a marble appearance.</li>
        <li>Bake in the oven at 350 degrees for 40-45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool and cut into squares.</li>
    </ol>
